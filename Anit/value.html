    <p>A flower is the reproductive part of a plant that produces seeds, which eventually grow into new flowers. Flowers are made up of four whorls, or layers, that form the flower's main structure:
        Calyx
        The outermost layer of the flower bud, made up of small, green, leaf-shaped sepals that protect the bud and support the petals while the flower is blooming
        Corolla
        The second outermost layer
        Androecium
        The third whorl, made up of male reproductive units called stamens that produce pollen grains containing sperm cells
        Gynoecium
        The innermost whorl, made up of the female reproductive part of the flower, called the carpels.Each carpel contains a stigma that receives pollen, a style that acts as a stalk, and an ovary that contains ovules. When fused, carpels are often called a pistil.
        Flowers can promote self-fertilization, where sperm and eggs come from the same flower, or cross-fertilization, where sperm and eggs come from different flowers. Pollination can be carried out by insects or the wind, and flowers often provide nectar to attract insects that help transfer pollen between flowers. After fertilization, the ovary develops into a fruit that contains a seed. 
        Flowers need sunlight and food to survive, and they make their own food through photosynthesis. There are an estimated 250,000â€“400,000 different species of flowers in the world, and each one can vary in color, smell, shape, and size</p>
