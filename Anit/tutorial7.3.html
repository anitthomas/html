    <p class="paragraph1">Bali is predominantly a Hindu country. Bali is known for its elaborate, traditional dancing. The dancing is inspired by its Hindu beliefs. Most of the dancing portrays tales of good versus evil. To watch the dancing is a breathtaking experience. Lombok has some impressive points of interest â€“ the majestic Gunung Rinjani is an active volcano. It is the second highest peak in Indonesia. Art is a Balinese passion. Batik paintings and carved statues make popular souvenirs. Artists can be seen whittling and painting on the streets, particularly in Ubud. It is easy to appreciate each island as an attractive tourist destination. Majestic scenery; rich culture; white sands and warm, azure waters draw visitors like magnets every year. Snorkelling and diving around the nearby Gili Islands is magnificent. Marine fish, starfish, turtles and coral reef are present in abundance. Bali and Lombok are part of the Indonesian archipelago. Bali has some spectacular temples. The most significant is the Mother Temple, Besakih. The inhabitants of Lombok are mostly Muslim with a Hindu minority. Lombok remains the most understated of the two islands. Lombok has several temples worthy of a visit, though they are less prolific. Bali and Lombok are neighbouring islands.</p>
    <p class="paragraph2">Martin Luther King Jr. led many demonstrations against racism. He delivered his message in a non-violent manner. Some members of his movement later engaged in less peaceful protests. Luther King was detained several times. The longest jail sentence he received was four months. Martin Luther King's famous 1963 speech, "I Have a Dream", inspired many African-Americans to envisage a better future. Luther King was an American citizen. Nelson Mandela is a native South African. Their dreams were the same. Their battles were tumultuous. Nelson Mandela was arrested in 1962 for treason. He was incarcerated for twenty-seven years. Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr. both fought for racial equality. The intolerance of white people towards black co-inhabitants was the catalyst for years of activism. In 1994, Nelson Mandela became the first black president of South Africa. He was the first president elected by the people. Mandela and Luther King have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their dedication to improving civil rights for black people. During Nelson Mandela's best known speech in 1994, he recited "Our Deepest Fear", an inspirational poem by Marianne Williamson. Mandela initially avoided violence but ended up resorting to it following the massacre of unarmed black Africans by the government. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968</p>
